## 1.1. Entities Diagram
![Diagram.png](https://d257b89266utxb.cloudfront.net/galaxy/images/galaxy/1659682658861468090.png)

### 1.1.1. Space

Space is used for aggregating your campaigns.

### 1.1.2. Campaign

Campaign is the key object that holds all info for NFT claiming process. Except info of itself, like campaign name, thumbnail, description, it also contains info of NFT contract, NFT template etc.

### 1.1.3. NFT Core

NFT contract(ERC-721) that used for minting NFTs within the campaign.

### 1.1.4. NFT Template

NFT template of the campaign contains info that used for generating metadata of a minted NFT. Including NFT name, image, traits etc.

### 1.1.5. Credential

Credential is elemental object that determine whether an address is eligible to claim the NFT. It takes a single wallet address as input and outputs 0(false)/1(true) to indicate whether the wallet address is eligible for this credentail.

### 1.1.6. Formula

Formula is a algebraic expression of credentials and entries, the output of formula decide whether and how many NFTs a user can claim witin the campaign. e.g. (C_2&C_3)*1 means a user eligible for both credential 2 and 3 can claim one NFT, (C_4|C_5)*2 means a user eligible for either credential 4 and 5 can claim two NFTs.

## 1.2. Integration workflow

1. Sign up for Galxe Dashboard access, please refer to [Sign Up for Beta Access | Galxe Docs](https://docs.galxe.com/guide/dashboard-tutorial/beta-signup) .
2. Create credentials through the Dashboard. Upload data for your credentials if their source is CSV file.
3. Create NFT core(NFT contract) if needed, if you are only need to intergrate OAT campaign, then it’s not needed.
4. Create space through the Dashboard.
5. Create campaign with with “Integrate campaign claiming into third-party websites” checked  under your space through the Dashboard. *(This will turn the campaign into gasless mode, right now we only support integrate gasless claim)*
6. Go to your campaign page inside Galxe to check if the campaign info is correct and credentials lighted up for eligible users.
7. Release your campaign through Dashboard.
8. Integrate `query campaign` API, get campaign info data for rendering your NFT claim page.
9. If you need to check whether a user is eligible to claim before hand, integrate `query campaign` API to get `eligible(address:String!)` field of credential object and use `formula` field to calculate the result on your side.
10. Integrate `mutation prepareParticipate`  API, send the claim request once user claim.
11. If needed, integrate `query participations` API to check Tx status periodically.
12. If you want, integrate `query campaign` API and get `holders(first:Int, after:String)` field info to setup NFTs showcase page.
