# Governance Process

_Project Galaxy DAO and GAL is NOT live. The following governance process will start to take effect right after the GAL token generation event._

Project Galaxy DAO is controlled by GAL holders. GAL holders have the ability to control the amount of the Platform Fee collected by the protocol, and control funds held by the Project Galaxy Community Treasury. All proposals need to go through a three-step process described below. In order for a proposal to pass, it must have over 50% passing votes with endorsement from wallet addresses holding at least 2,000,000 GAL, with delegation allowed. When a proposal is passed, the changes will be implemented by Project Galaxy’s operation team and signed by the multi-sig, if necessary.

## Proposal

All proposals need to go through the following process:

### Phase 1: Temperature Check — Discourse

The purpose of the Temperature Check is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo. To create a Temperature Check, ask a general, non-biased question to the community on [forum](https://to.galaxy.eco/dI1ew2) about a potential change (example: “Should Project Galaxy DAO launch a new achievement mining campaign?”). Temperature checks are informal. It is for you to use the feedback to decide if you want to proceed further with your proposal.

### Phase 2: Draft Proposal — Github

The purpose of the Draft Proposal is to establish formal discussion around a potential proposal. To create a Draft Proposal

1. [Fork](https://github.com/ProjectGalaxyHQ/galaxy-docs) the Galaxy Docs repository on Github
2. Add your GP to your fork of the repository, under folder `doc-governance/proposals/`
3. Submit a Pull Request

Your PR will be reviewed by a contributor to check its readiness taking into account of the feedback from the Temperature Check. If the GP is not ready, the contributor will send it back to the author for revision. If the GP is ready, the proposal will be assigned with a GP number to be voted by GAL holders.

### Phase 3: Vote Proposal — Snapshot

Once your GP is assigned with a proposal number, you can work with the operation team to schedule a [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/project-galaxy.eth) vote. The snapshot vote will last for 5 days. In order for a proposal to pass, the GP must have:

1. Over 50% passing votes
2. Endorsement from wallet addresses holding at least 2,000,000 GAL

Delegation is allowed through [this](https://snapshot.org/#/delegate/project-galaxy.eth) link.

## Implementation

When a proposal is passed, the changes will be implemented by Project Galaxy’s operation team and signed by the multi-sig, if necessary.

## Multi-signature Signers

The multi-signature wallet signers will be voted in by GAL holders after token generation event. They are also subject to change from future governance votes.
