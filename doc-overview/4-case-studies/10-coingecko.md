# Case Study: Learn-to-earn with Coin Gecko

### “DeFi 101” NFT Campaign

## Challenge

The fast-growing DeFi space is quite overwhelming for new users entering the space and even for full degens, it’s hard to keep up with all the innovation and changes. Galxe and Coin Gecko wanted to create a fun way to educate and incentivize DeFi beginners and enthusiasts on the Web3 ecosystem. 

## Solution

In collaboration, we created the ultimate DeFi course to reward and incentive users through a learn-to-earn formula. The “DeFi 101” NFT Campaign included 5 courses, each with its own task on different DeFi protocols. Users received badges for each accomplished task and honor student badges were given to users that completed all 5 courses.  

## Results

A total of 16,730 users participated in the campaign and over 2600 OATs (On-chain achievement tokens) were minted for each course. The campaign also helped each individual protocol grow their communities and have new users learn more about the world of Web3.

Galxe OATs are used for validation that a user performed an action or participated in a specific event.

Available on Polygon and BNB chains, OATs appear in all NFT marketplaces so you can show them off.
