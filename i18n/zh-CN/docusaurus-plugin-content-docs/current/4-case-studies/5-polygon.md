# NFT Marketplace Growth with OpenSea on Polygon

### The Polygon Genesis Creator

## Challenge

Back in July 2021, Polygon launched its blockchain gaming & NFT Studios. After 6 months on the market, Polygon Studios was looking for ways to increase NFT creators and buyers on the Polygon Network.

## Solution

In collaboration with Galxe, [Polygon Studio](https://twitter.com/polygonstudios) launched an [interactive campaign](https://galxe.com/polygon) that promoted the use of the Polygon network. Users were able to be rewarded in 3 ways :

1. Creating an NFT on OpenSea through the Polygon Network
2. Buying an NFT on OpenSea through the Polygon Network
3. Selling an NFT on OpenSea through the Polygon Network

The rewards were claimed by using the Galxe mystery box.  Users who collected all 4 different NFTs from the mystery box were able to burn and forge them together which created the Polygon Genesis Creator, a higher tier NFT.

## Results

A total of 131,074 mystery box NFTs were minted. Over 9060 unique users forged all four of the mystery box NFTs and minted 14,977 of the higher tiered NFT: The Polygon Genesis Creator.

**About Polygon**

Its growing suite of products offers developers easy access to all major scaling and infrastructure solutions: L2 solutions (ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups), sidechains, hybrid solutions, stand-alone and enterprise chains, data availability solutions, and more.

**Galxe** **OAT**

Galaxy OATs (On-Chain Achievement Tokens) are a creative solution to distribute NFT badges to communities as a record of participation. Brands and projects can use Galxe’s infrastructure to create their own personalized OATs to reward their users. This includes anything from in-person events, various online interactions, or even AMA’s.

Galaxy OATs are used for validation that a user performed an action or participated in a specific event. You can transfer or sell your OAT, but the record of the action is stored on the Galaxy Credential data network. Available on Polygon and BNB chains, OATs appear in all NFT marketplaces so you can show them off.
